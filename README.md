# avatar-generator

A fun web app for generating symmetric, pixel-based icons. Yes I made this because I didn't like my god-given characterization (GitHub identicon hashing algorithm). But you can use this for other avatars or icons too. Built with **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and the HTML5 **Canvas API**.


## Features

- Random identicon generation
- Adjustable grid size 
- Random color generation
- Adjustable export size (in pixels)
- PNG export
- Fully responsive and mobile-friendly layout
